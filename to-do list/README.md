#  Python To-Do List Applications

This repository contains two versions of a To-Do List app built using Python and Tkinter (Python's built-in GUI library). These projects are ideal for learning how to build desktop applications with user-friendly interfaces â€” starting from a beginner level and progressing to a more advanced feature-rich version.
